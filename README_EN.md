„Äêchoose languageÔºö[‰∏≠Êñá‰ªãÁªç](https://github.com/qrpcode/wordgo/blob/master/README_CN.md)„Äë

### Background

In traditional Java Word generation, template files are usually created manually and then imported. If you don't want to create a template and want less code, it's a good idea to choose Word Go~~

### Installation

#### Manually import the jar package

* IDEA import: Click File-Project Structure; then find Modules on the left and click; finally, click the green + sign on the right, select JARs or directories and select the jar package to be imported.
* Eclipse import: right-click "Project" ‚Üí select Properties, select Java Build Path in the list on the left side of the pop-up dialog box

#### maven import

```xml
<dependency>
 <groupId>com.github.qrpcode</groupId>
 <artifactId>wordgo</artifactId>
 <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>
```

### Environment dependency and compatibility

It can be used as long as it can run java, it does not rely on any third-party Office applications

See the table for compatibility:

### Use

Let‚Äôs create a "Hello World" first

```java
WordGo wordGo = new WordGo();
//Create a new word
wordGo.add("Hello World", "font-size: 15; color: #FF0000");
//Fill in the data to view the corresponding function description
wordGo.create("C:\\demo.docx");
//Finally, it can be generated. The parameter is the generation directory, which must have a file name and end with. Docx
```

Yes, it is very similar to Css, it is easy to use~~

Code support JDK1.5 + (inclusive)
